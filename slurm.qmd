## Introduction

Slurm: Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management.

Slurm provides a queuing system for running jobs across a network of
machines.  This is useful in maths as we have many desktops that have
spare CPU cycles.

Slurm takes care of finding an empty machine, and runs the jobs for
you.

## The queue

You can see what is in the queue by running the *squeue* command.
This will show you jobs that are currently running, and those that are
waiting to be run.


## What is a job?

A job is a shell-script program that you wish to run.  It can contain
meta-data for the slurm process to specify the needs of the job,
e.g. max duration, memory required.  Here is a very simple job.



## When is next downtime?

    scontrol show reservation
